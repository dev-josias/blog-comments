# Blog Comments Storage

This repository acts as the storage backend for comments on my personal portfolio and blog.

It utilizes [Giscus](https://giscus.app) to map blog posts to GitHub Discussions in this repository.

## How it works
- Each blog post on my website automatically creates a corresponding Discussion thread here.
- Users comment via the Giscus widget on the website.
- Comments are stored as replies in these discussions.

## Configuration
This repository must remain **Public** for comments to be visible to all visitors.
Discussion categories (e.g., "Announcements") are used to organize threads.
